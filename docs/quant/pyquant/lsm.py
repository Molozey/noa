class LSMResult:
    """Represents the computation result of LSM algorithm.

    Attributes:
        option_price:
            Price of the option at initial moment of time. Shape: (1, ).
        stop_S_vals:
            Price values of the underlying for early exercise curve.
        stop_t_vals:
            Time values for early exercise curve.
        C_hats:
            Continuation value approximations for in-the-money subset of
            underlying paths at each moment of time. Length: N_STEPS + 1
        y_vals:
            Values of dependent variable for regression for in-the-money
            subset of underlying paths at each moment of time Length: N_STEPS + 1.
        paths_itm_vals:
            Values of in-the-money subset of underlying paths at each moment of time.
            Length: N_STEPS + 1.

    Notes:
        - `stop_S_vals` and `stop_t_vals` have the same length which becomes known
        only after algorithm is executed.
        - `N_STEPS` is the number of time steps in paths of the underlying asset
        (input for the LSM algorithm).
        - For each index `i`, the tensors `C_hats[i]`, `paths_itm_vals[i]` and `y_vals[i]`
        have the same length. For explanation of these variables, see [Seydel2017],
        section 3.6.3, algorithm 3.14, item (c).
